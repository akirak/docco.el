* Docco.el
Docco.el is a framework for editing documentation comments inside source code.
It aims to be generic enough to support various programming languages and is desiged to be extensible.

It relies on the built-in tree-sitter support of Emacs (i.e. ~treesit~) to define structural patterns easily.
For major modes that are not based on ~treesit~ or have only a poorly-defined parser, regular expressions are used to define patterns.
** Supported Languages
- ~rust-ts-mode~ (Rust)
- ~gleam-ts-mode~ (Gleam)
- ~elixir-ts-mode~ (Elixir)
- ~typescript-ts-mode~ (TypeScript)
** Usage
- ~docco-edit-module-comment~ for editing a documentation comment of the current module
- ~docco-edit-function-comment~ for editing a documentation comment of the function at point
